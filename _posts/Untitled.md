Reasons Why Online concert cannot change

For the past 5 years, I have been going to a music festival every summer. For me, summer means that the day of the music festival is approaching. However, in the Pandemic era, the fact that most of the music festivals has been switched online or canceled makes me sad.

First, you can feel freedom from your daily life. The freedom of being surrounded by people you don't know, all united to enjoy a shared experience makes you express your true personality. music festival provide an opportunity for escapism.

Second, music festival provide not only music, but also nonmusical experiences, which contribute to the fun and festival atmosphere. This includes everything from the food and drink, to the lighting and entertainment.

Last, you can get to know other artist besides your favorite artist. I always check if my favorite artist comes out and decide which music festival to go to. However, while enjoying the music festival, I get to know other artists and end up listen to their music all year round.
